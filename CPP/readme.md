# Smart Building Energy Management System

Smart Building Energy Management System is a simple C++-based approach to handle energy efficiency in a building. Since it relies solely on software without any hardware, it is designed for a single room accommodating up to five people. With this tool, you can automatically regulate the AC/Heater based on the number of occupants in the room. Further optimization will be achieved with the integration of hardware support into this project.
